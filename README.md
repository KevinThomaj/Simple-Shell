# Simple-Shell
It is a simple implementation of a shell in C. I built this project to understand how a shell works under the hood.<br/>
I'm here to learn😁. <br/>
Simple-Shell can run in two different modes: <br/>
1) Interactive mode: run the program with 0 arguments, and after that you can you use it like a normal shell.
   >./shell

2) Batch mode: run the program with 1 argument: the batch file with all of the commands, the program will interpret and execute all of the commands in that file.
   >./shell batch.txt
